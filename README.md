# My Node.js App

This is a simple Node.js application designed for demonstrating a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. The app uses Docker and docker-compose for deployment to a staging environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or higher)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- A GitHub repository for CI/CD integration

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
2. Start the Application
To start the application locally, use:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app will run on http://localhost:3000.

3. Run Tests
You can run the tests using:

bash
Copy code
npm test
4. Build and Deploy with Docker Compose
To deploy the app in a staging environment, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --build
This will start the application as a Docker container.

Environment Variables and Secrets
Required Environment Variables
PORT: The port on which the application will run (default: 3000).
GitHub Actions Secrets
For the CI/CD pipeline, configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password or access token.
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: SSH key for deployment (if required).
Files Overview
Dockerfile
